## Assisting people with names

### This software will help people that have a lot of name to remember to have a system that can help them build that memory of all the new faces. This will be a local data base as to not be a privacy concern. 

### I had many issues getting this to work with dlib.

### Deepface seems to have issues imporving face matching.

### Haar Cascade needs work inorder to improve accuracy.
